## 1. PURPOSE

This **Capital Expenditure Approval Policy** (the "Policy") establishes the required procedures, authorization levels, and controls necessary for the planning, requisitioning, approval, acquisition, and tracking of all capital assets and expenditures by **TechCorp Solutions Inc.** ("TechCorp").

The primary goal of this Policy is to ensure that all capital investments are aligned with the strategic objectives of the organization, provide a demonstrable Return on Investment (ROI), are appropriately budgeted, and adhere to rigorous internal controls required for financial stewardship and compliance (including Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Section 404 requirements).

This framework minimizes financial risk, prevents unauthorized spending, promotes efficient resource allocation across all departments (Engineering, Operations, G&A), and maintains the integrity of the company’s fixed asset register.

## 2. SCOPE

This Policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party agents acting on behalf of TechCorp involved in proposing, reviewing, approving, purchasing, receiving, or implementing any expenditure that meets the criteria for **Capitalization** as defined by the Accounting Department.

**Coverage includes:**
*   All purchases, leases, or long-term contracts for property, plant, and equipment (PP&E).
*   Acquisitions of internally developed software exceeding the capitalization threshold.
*   Major upgrades, enhancements, or replacements of existing fixed assets.
*   Geographic Scope: This applies globally to all TechCorp subsidiaries and operational sites.

**Exclusions:**
*   Expenditures classified as **Operating Expenses (OpEx)** under \$1,000, irrespective of asset life.
*   Routine maintenance and standard repairs.
*   Expenditures covered specifically under the **IT Procurement and Licensing Policy (IT-005)**, unless the total project spend exceeds the \$50,000 Capitalization Threshold.

## 3. DEFINITIONS

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)** | An expenditure for the acquisition or improvement of a long-term asset that increases the asset’s capacity, efficiency, or useful life, meeting or exceeding the **Capitalization Threshold** of **\$10,000**. |
| **Capitalization Threshold** | The minimum monetary value (\$10,000) above which an asset purchase must be recorded on the balance sheet rather than expensed immediately. |
| **Departmental Budget Holder (DBH)** | The individual (typically VP or Director level) responsible for managing the approved operating and capital budget for a specific department or cost center. |
| **Procurement Department** | The centralized function responsible for vendor negotiation, contract management, and issuing Purchase Orders (POs). |
| **Purchase Requisition (PR)** | The formal internal document used to initiate the procurement process for goods or services, regardless of funding source. |
| **Return on Investment (ROI)** | A metric used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment, calculated as (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) $\times$ 100%. Required for all CapEx over \$50,000. |
| **Asset Disposal** | The formal process of removing a fixed asset from the company’s books, requiring documentation of salvage value or write-off authorization. |
| **Emergency CapEx** | An unplanned capital expenditure deemed immediately necessary for business continuity or critical security remediation, overriding standard lead times but not standard approval authority levels. |

## 4. POLICY STATEMENTS

### 4.1 Capital Classification and Thresholds

*   All expenditures must be correctly classified as either **CapEx** or **OpEx** prior to initiating the Purchase Requisition (PR). If the cost is expected to exceed **\$10,000** and provides future economic benefit, it **must** be treated as CapEx.
*   Any single item or related group of items exceeding **\$1,000** but less than the **\$10,000** threshold **shall** be reviewed by the DBH for potential capitalization, though standard accounting rules may allow for immediate expensing.
*   All proposed CapEx projects with a total estimated cost exceeding **\$500,000** **must** be submitted to the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) for review, regardless of departmental budget allocation.

### 4.2 Approval Authority Matrix and Segregation of Duties

*   **Mandatory Segregation of Duties:** The individual who initiates the Purchase Requisition (PR) **shall not** be the same individual with the final approval authority for that specific expenditure, nor shall they be the individual responsible for receiving or processing the final vendor invoice.
*   **Tiered Approval Requirements:** Approvals **must** follow the hierarchy detailed in Appendix A, based on the total project value:
    *   Expenditures between **\$10,001 and \$49,999** require approval from the initiating Department Head and the Departmental Budget Holder (DBH).
    *   Expenditures between **\$50,000 and \$249,999** require approval from the DBH, the relevant Business Unit Head, and the VP of Finance.
    *   Expenditures between **\$250,000 and \$499,999** require the VP of Finance and final sign-off from the CFO.
*   **High-Value Approvals:** Any CapEx exceeding **\$500,000** **shall** require formal approval by the Chief Operating Officer (COO) and the CFO, and must be presented to the Audit Committee for notification within 30 days of commitment.

### 4.3 Budgetary Control and Documentation

*   No Purchase Requisition (PR) **shall** be processed by Procurement without an approved, allocated budget code verified by the Accounting Department, except in documented **Emergency CapEx** situations.
*   For all CapEx greater than **\$50,000**, the PR **must** include a documented business case detailing the strategic rationale, projected financial benefits (ROI calculation), and a risk assessment.
*   Departmental Budget Holders **must** report any projected CapEx variance exceeding **10%** of the approved annual CapEx budget to the FP&A team within **15 business days** of identifying the variance.
*   TechCorp **must** maintain an auditable trail, including all digital approvals, supporting documentation, and the final Purchase Order (PO), linking directly to the asset in the Fixed Asset Register for a minimum of seven years, in compliance with SOX 404 requirements.

### 4.4 Vendor Management and Acquisition

*   For any single CapEx purchase exceeding **\$100,000**, Procurement **shall** obtain, at minimum, three competitive bids from qualified, approved vendors, unless a sole-source justification memo is approved by the CFO.
*   All vendor contract terms related to capital assets (including maintenance/warranty periods) **must** be reviewed by the Legal Department before final approval signature by the CFO or COO.
*   The use of personal credit cards or non-corporate payment methods for any expenditure requiring CapEx approval is **strictly prohibited**.

### 4.5 Recommended Practices

*   Departmental leadership **should** review their proposed CapEx needs for the subsequent fiscal year no later than September 1st to ensure sufficient time for comprehensive business case preparation and ELT review.
*   Employees **should** explore leasing or subscription models for IT hardware where the anticipated useful life of the equipment is less than four years, subject to financial modeling comparison against outright purchase.

## 5. PROCEDURES

### 5.1 Purchase Requisition (PR) Initiation for CapEx

1.1. The Requester (any non-managerial employee) drafts the requirement, identifying the asset specifications and estimated cost, and submits it via the ERP system (e.g., SAP or Oracle).

1.2. If the cost exceeds \$10,000, the Requester **must** attach a preliminary **Capital Justification Form (CJF-002)**, including preliminary ROI projections if applicable.

1.3. The system automatically routes the PR to the immediate **Departmental Budget Holder (DBH)** for initial budget verification and endorsement, ensuring the necessary funds are available within the current fiscal year’s approved capital plan.

### 5.2 Multi-Tiered Approval Workflow

2.1. Upon DBH approval, the PR proceeds based on the value, triggering alerts to the required higher-level approvers as detailed in Section 4.2.

2.2. For assets exceeding \$250,000, the CFO’s office will coordinate a mandatory review by the FP&A team to confirm the financial model's accuracy and impact on cash flow forecasts **before** issuing final approval.

2.3. Once all required signatures are digitally captured, the system generates a system-verified Purchase Order (PO) number and automatically notifies the Procurement Department.

### 5.3 Asset Reception and Fixed Asset Setup

3.1. Upon physical receipt of the asset, the designated **Receiving Clerk** (independent of the Requester or Approver) verifies the quantity and condition against the PO and signs the receiving report in the ERP system.

3.2. The Receiving Report triggers an automated notification to the Accounting Department, which is responsible for:
    *   Confirming the asset meets the **Capitalization Threshold** (\$10,000).
    *   Calculating the appropriate depreciation schedule (Straight-Line over the asset’s useful life).
    *   Assigning a unique **Asset Tag Number** and recording the asset in the Fixed Asset Register.

3.4. The Accounting Department **must** complete the Fixed Asset registration within **10 working days** of receiving the signed Receiving Report.
