## 2. PURPOSE

The purpose of this **Remote Work and Flexible Work Arrangements Policy** is to establish clear guidelines, expectations, and procedures for employees engaging in work outside of a designated TechNova Solutions office location, or utilizing non-standard work schedules. This policy ensures equitable treatment, maintains high levels of productivity, safeguards company assets, and complies with all applicable labor laws.

This policy is designed to support TechNova Solutions' strategic goal of attracting and retaining top-tier global talent by offering flexibility where operational needs permit. It reinforces our core value of **Trust and Accountability**, ensuring that performance standards are met regardless of physical location, while mitigating risks associated with distributed teams, particularly concerning data security and compliance (e.g., **GDPR** and **PCI-DSS** requirements for sensitive data handling).

---

## 3. SCOPE

This policy applies to all **full-time and regular part-time employees** of TechNova Solutions globally, unless explicitly excluded by a separate collective bargaining agreement or specific jurisdictional mandate.

**Covered Arrangements:**
*   **Remote Work:** Any arrangement where the employee regularly performs their duties from an approved off-site location (e.g., home office).
*   **Hybrid Work:** Arrangements combining scheduled days in the office and remote days.
*   **Flexible Scheduling:** Arrangements involving non-standard start/end times or compressed workweeks, provided core business hours (10:00 AM to 3:00 PM local time) are covered.

**Exclusions:**
Roles deemed **mission-critical, security-sensitive, or requiring physical presence** (e.g., Lab Technicians, Data Center Operations, certain Finance/Payroll functions) are generally ineligible for routine remote work, unless a temporary exception is approved by the Department Head and CHRO.

**Geographic Scope:** Employees must reside and perform work within the jurisdiction where they are legally authorized to work, as specified in their employment agreement. International remote work requires specific approval under Section 5.

1.  **Eligibility:** Employees **must** have completed a minimum of six (6) continuous months of satisfactory employment with TechNova Solutions before being eligible to apply for a formal FWA or Remote Work arrangement.

3.  **International Work:** Employees **must not** work from a country outside their primary employment jurisdiction for more than ten (10) consecutive business days in a calendar year, unless explicitly approved by Legal and Tax departments due to permanent relocation agreements.

### 5.2 Performance and Conduct Expectations

4.  **Performance Review:** Employees under an FWA **shall** be subject to the same rigorous performance review cycles and criteria as on-site employees. Failure to meet established **Productivity Metrics (PM)** for two consecutive review periods **will** result in the automatic review and potential revocation of the FWA.
5.  **Availability:** All employees **must** be reachable via standard company communication channels (Slack, Email, Phone) during **Core Business Hours (CBH)** and respond to urgent requests within fifteen (15) minutes.
6.  **Employee Conduct:** All professional conduct standards outlined in the Employee Handbook remain fully enforceable, regardless of the work location. Misconduct occurring in the DSW **will** be subject to the standard disciplinary procedures.
7.  **Confidentiality:** Employees **are required to** maintain strict confidentiality of all proprietary information (Intellectual Property, Client Data, Financials) and **must not** use personal devices or unsecured networks for accessing sensitive data, especially those classified as Tier 1 or Tier 2 under the Data Classification Policy (HR-010).

### 5.3 Workplace Safety and Equipment

8.  **Workplace Safety:** Employees working remotely **must** complete the annual **Ergonomic Assessment** and certify that their DSW is free from foreseeable hazards. TechNova Solutions’ liability for workplace injury occurring outside the DSW is limited, except where the injury is directly caused by company-provided, faulty equipment.
9.  **Equipment Provision:** TechNova Solutions **will** provide essential company-owned computing hardware (laptop, monitor) necessary for the role. The employee **is responsible** for maintaining high-speed internet access and providing necessary office furnishings (desk, chair), though a stipend may be available as per the Expense Reimbursement Policy (FIN-005).
10. **Insurance Obligation:** Employees **must** maintain adequate homeowner's or renter's insurance that covers liability for business activities conducted within their DSW. Proof of coverage **shall** be provided to HR upon request.

### 5.4 Leave and Attendance

11. **Leave Approval:** Requests for planned Paid Time Off (PTO) or Sick Leave **must** be submitted and approved via the HRIS system at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance, except in cases of verifiable medical emergency.
12. **Training Compliance:** Employees utilizing specialized software or handling regulated data (e.g., **SOX** compliance documentation) **must** complete mandatory refresher training modules within thirty (30) days of any policy update, regardless of their physical location.

### 5.5 Prohibitions and Termination of Arrangement

13. **Prohibited Use:** The DSW **must not** be used as a permanent, unlicensed secondary business location or to host unauthorized third-party personnel during working hours, unless approved for collaborative purposes.
14. **Arrangement Review:** Any significant change in the employee's residential address or primary reporting structure **requires** a formal FWA amendment request to be submitted to the Manager and HR Operations within five (5) business days.
15. **Revocation:** TechNova Solutions **reserves the right** to revoke any FWA or Remote Work agreement with thirty (30) days written notice, or immediately in cases of confirmed security breaches, severe performance deficiencies, or demonstrable operational need.

## 6. PROCEDURES

### 6.1 Procedure for Requesting a New FWA/Remote Work Arrangement

1.1. **Employee Submission:** The employee completes the **"FWA Request Form"** (Appendix A), detailing the proposed schedule, justification, and DSW location, and submits it to their direct Manager.

1.2. **Manager Review:** The Manager assesses the request based on role requirements, team coverage needs, and the employee's last two performance review ratings. The Manager **must** provide a documented recommendation (Approved, Denied, or Conditional Approval) within seven (7) business days.

1.3. **HR Operations Vetting:** If recommended, HR Operations verifies eligibility (Section 5.1.1), confirms necessary training completion (Section 5.2.12), and checks for any existing disciplinary actions against the employee.

1.4. **Final Approval:** For standard Hybrid Arrangements (up to 3 days remote), the Department Head provides final approval. For **Full Remote Arrangements**, the **CHRO** must provide final sign-off before the arrangement commences.

1.5. **Documentation and Commencement:** Upon final approval, the arrangement, including specific **Productivity Metrics (PMs)**, is formally documented in the HRIS system, and the employee receives the official acknowledgement email. The arrangement commences on the agreed-upon start date.

### 6.2 Procedure for Addressing Non-Compliance

2.1. **Initial Observation:** If a Manager observes potential non-compliance (e.g., missed CBH availability, failure to meet PMs), they **must** document the specific instance with time, date, and impact assessment.

2.2. **First Warning (Informal):** The Manager holds a documented coaching session with the employee, referencing the relevant Policy Sections (e.g., 5.2.5). A written summary of the discussion is placed in the employee's digital file.

2.3. **Second Warning (Formal):** If the issue recurs within ninety (90) days, HR Operations issues a formal Written Warning, explicitly stating that the FWA is under review and may be revoked per Section 5.2.15.

2.4. **Escalation/Revocation:** If compliance fails to improve following the Formal Warning, the CHRO, upon recommendation from the Department Head, may initiate the full revocation process, requiring the employee to return to full on-site status within ten (10) business days, or proceed to broader disciplinary action up to and including termination.
