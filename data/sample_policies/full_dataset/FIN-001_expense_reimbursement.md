## 2. PURPOSE

This **Expense Reimbursement Policy** establishes the guidelines and procedures for employees seeking reimbursement for reasonable and necessary business expenses incurred on behalf of **TechCorp Solutions** (the "Company"). The primary goal is to ensure that all expenditures are properly documented, align with budgetary constraints, and comply with internal controls and relevant tax regulations.

This policy is critical for maintaining fiscal discipline and transparency across all departments. By standardizing the reimbursement process, we mitigate the risk of unauthorized spending, ensure accurate financial reporting, and support our commitment to **SOX 404 compliance** regarding internal controls over financial reporting.

Adherence to this policy reflects TechCorp's value of **Stewardship**, ensuring that company resources are used efficiently and ethically to achieve strategic business objectives.

## 3. SCOPE

This policy applies to **all employees** of TechCorp Solutions, including full-time, part-time, temporary staff, and external contractors incurring expenses on behalf of the Company, regardless of their location.

This policy covers all financial transactions related to employee out-of-pocket spending, including but not limited to travel, meals, entertainment, supplies, and professional development costs. All reimbursements must be processed through the **Concur Expense Management System**.

**Geographic Scope:** This policy applies globally, though local statutory tax requirements may necessitate minor procedural deviations, which must be documented and approved by the Controller’s Office.

**Exclusions:** This policy **does not** cover direct corporate credit card charges, payroll advances, or capital expenditures (CAPEX), which are governed by Policy FIN-003 (Capital Expenditure Authorization Policy).
