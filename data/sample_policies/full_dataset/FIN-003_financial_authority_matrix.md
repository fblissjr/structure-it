## 2. PURPOSE

This **Financial Authority Matrix and Approval Limits Policy (FIN-003)** establishes the clear delegation of financial authority, spending limits, and approval requirements for all personnel within **TechCorp Global, Inc.** (the "Company"). The primary goal is to ensure that financial commitments, disbursements, capital expenditures, and budgetary deviations are executed efficiently, appropriately governed, and aligned with fiduciary responsibilities.

This policy addresses the business problem of inconsistent authorization levels and potential financial exposure arising from unauthorized or poorly vetted expenditures. By standardizing these limits, TechCorp enhances **Segregation of Duties (SoD)**, strengthens internal controls compliant with **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) Section 404** requirements, and protects corporate assets.

Adherence to FIN-003 directly supports TechCorp’s strategic pillar of **Operational Excellence and Financial Stewardship**, ensuring that all financial activities reflect prudence, transparency, and accountability across all departments, including Engineering, Sales, and Research & Development (R&D).

## 6. PROCEDURES

### 6.1 Procedure for Initiating a Purchase Order (PO) Exceeding \$25,000

1.1. The Requestor identifies the need and secures preliminary verbal confirmation from the Budget Owner regarding fund availability.
1.2. The Requestor enters the requisition into the Procurement System, correctly classifying the expense as CAPEX or OPEX, and attaches all necessary supporting documentation (quotes, SOW).
1.3. The system automatically routes the requisition to the Budget Owner for confirmation of funding (Level 1 Approval).
1.4. Upon Budget Owner approval, the system routes the request to the designated Director Level approver, who verifies business need and compliance with procurement best practices (Level 2 Approval).
1.5. If the amount is between \$25,001 and \$100,000, the system escalates to the relevant VP for final commitment approval (Level 3 Approval).
1.6. If the amount exceeds \$100,000, the system escalates to the CFO for mandatory final commitment approval (Level 4 Approval).
1.7. Upon final approval, the Procurement Desk generates the official PO and transmits it to the vendor.

### 6.2 Procedure for Material Budget Variance Reporting

2.1. At month-end close, the Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) team generates the actual vs. budget report for all cost centers.
2.2. FP&A flags any cost center exhibiting a **Material Variance** (per 5.5.2).
2.3. The flagged Budget Owner **must** draft the Variance Explanation Report (VER) detailing the cause (e.g., timing shift, unforeseen cost increase) and corrective action plan.
2.4. The VER **must** be reviewed by the relevant SVP and submitted electronically to the CFO via the centralized reporting repository within the required **ten (10) business day** window.
2.5. The CFO reviews the VERs quarterly with the Audit Committee, focusing on systemic variances or repeated occurrences by the same Budget Owner.

### 6.3 Procedure for Expense Report Submission (Post-Deadline)

3.1. If an employee submits an expense report between 31 and 90 days post-incurrence, the system automatically rejects it and assigns a mandatory review to the immediate Manager.
3.2. The Manager reviews the report, confirms the validity of the expense, and notes the delay reason in the comments section.
3.3. If the Manager approves the delayed report, the system routes it to the functional VP for secondary approval, acknowledging the late submission.
3.4. For reports submitted after 90 days, the system bypasses standard approval and requires mandatory written justification from the employee, followed by direct written approval from the **CFO** only. Processing of expenses approved under this procedure **should** be prioritized below all on-time submissions.
