## 2. PURPOSE

The purpose of this **Records Retention and Document Management Policy** (the "Policy") is to establish mandatory guidelines for the creation, maintenance, retention, storage, and disposition of all corporate records generated or received by **TechCorp Solutions Inc.** ("TechCorp"). This Policy ensures that TechCorp meets its legal, regulatory, fiscal, and operational requirements while mitigating the risks associated with retaining unnecessary or excessively long-held data.

This Policy addresses the complexities arising from global operations, evolving data privacy mandates (such as **GDPR** and **CCPA**), financial reporting obligations (**Sarbanes-Oxley Act - SOX**), and the necessity of preserving critical evidence during potential litigation or regulatory inquiry. Adherence to this Policy supports TechCorp’s commitment to operational efficiency, data security, and robust corporate governance, aligning directly with our strategic objective of maintaining the highest standards of compliance and risk management.

---

## 3. SCOPE

This Policy applies to **all employees, contingent workers, contractors, and temporary staff** of TechCorp Solutions Inc., regardless of their geographic location or employment status, who create, receive, manage, or have access to TechCorp records.

This Policy covers all **Records**, irrespective of format or media, including but not limited to:
1.  Electronic data stored in enterprise systems (e.g., ERP, CRM, HRIS, internal shared drives, cloud storage like SharePoint/AWS S3, email archives).
2.  Hard copy documents (paper files, microfiche).
3.  Communications records (including instant messages, collaboration platform data, and voicemail).

**Geographic Scope:** This Policy applies globally, but departmental retention schedules must incorporate the most stringent requirements imposed by the jurisdiction in which the records are created or processed.

**Exclusions:** This Policy does not cover the following, which are governed by separate internal policies:
*   Source code repositories (governed by LEG-005: Software Intellectual Property Policy).
*   Physical assets and inventory records (governed by FIN-008: Asset Management Policy).
*   Trade secrets explicitly identified and protected under separate confidentiality agreements.

## 8. COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

**Monitoring:** Compliance with this Policy will be monitored through routine internal audits conducted by the Internal Audit function, focusing on: (a) adherence to documented disposition procedures (Section 6.1); and (b) spot-checks of high-risk repositories (e.g., HR and Finance shared drives) for unauthorized storage of PII.

**Audit Procedures:** During scheduled compliance audits, auditors **shall** select a sample set of Records nearing the end of their mandated retention period and trace the corresponding Disposition Request Form (LEG-002-F1) to confirm appropriate authorization occurred prior to destruction.

**Consequences of Violations:** Violations of this Policy, particularly the unauthorized destruction of evidence or retention of PII beyond mandated timelines, will result in disciplinary action. This may range from a formal written warning for minor, accidental non-compliance to immediate termination of employment and referral to external regulatory authorities or legal counsel for intentional acts or gross negligence. Violations related to Legal Holds may subject the employee to personal liability.

**Reporting Violations:** Employees **should** report suspected violations confidentially to the Compliance Officer or directly to the General Counsel via the established Whistleblower Hotline (Extension 5555).
