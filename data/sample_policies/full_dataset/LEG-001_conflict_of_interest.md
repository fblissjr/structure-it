## 2. PURPOSE

This **Conflict of Interest and Disclosure Policy** (the "Policy") establishes the standards and procedures governing potential, actual, and perceived conflicts of interest for all employees, officers, and directors of **TechSolutions Global Inc.** ("the Company").

3.  **Material Financial Interest Threshold:** An employee **shall not** hold a Material Financial Interest in any Third-Party Vendor or competitor, **unless** that interest was disclosed and formally approved by the General Counsel and the Audit Committee, as required under SOX compliance procedures.
4.  **Gifts and Entertainment Threshold:** Employees **must not** accept any gift, entertainment, or personal benefit from a Third-Party Vendor that has a fair market value exceeding **$500** per instance, or cumulative value exceeding **$1,500** from a single source within any calendar year, unless expressly pre-approved by the Department Head and documented.
5.  **Use of Confidential Information:** Employees **shall not** use non-public Company information obtained through their position for personal financial gain or the benefit of any Related Party. This obligation continues indefinitely after the termination of employment.
6.  **Related Party Employment:** Hiring or supervising a Related Party **shall not** occur within the same direct reporting line.

7.  **Company Time and Resources:** Employees **are required to** dedicate their full professional time and attention to Company business during scheduled working hours.

## 6. PROCEDURES

The following procedures detail the required steps for compliance with this Policy:

1.2. **Submission:** The individual **must** complete the electronic Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form (Appendix A) within the mandated timeframe (see 5.2).
1.3. **Initial Triage (HR/Manager):** If the individual is an employee, the immediate Manager reviews the disclosure for factual accuracy and completeness. If the Manager is the disclosing party, the review defaults to the next level up.
1.4. **Legal Review (Policy Owner Responsibility):** All disclosures **shall** be forwarded to the Legal Department (Policy Owner) for formal assessment against the Policy criteria and relevant regulatory requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS implications if a vendor is involved).

If one exists, a mitigation plan (e.g., recusal, divestiture, or termination of the relationship) **must** be documented and agreed upon by the affected individual within **fifteen (15) days**.

### 6.2. Investigation of Alleged Violations

2.1. **Reporting:** Any employee who suspects a violation of this Policy **must** report the concern via the Ethics Hotline or directly to the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO).
2.2. **Assessment:** The CCO, in coordination with the Policy Owner, **shall** conduct an immediate, preliminary assessment to determine if the allegation warrants a formal investigation.
2.3. **Investigation:** If warranted, the CCO will appoint an independent investigative team (often involving external counsel or internal Audit) to gather facts. The subject of the investigation **shall** be informed promptly, unless notification would impede the investigation.
2.4. **Remediation:** Based on substantiated findings, the CCO will recommend disciplinary action to the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) or Board of Directors, adhering strictly to the enforcement provisions outlined in Section 8.
