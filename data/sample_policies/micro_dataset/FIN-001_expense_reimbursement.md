## 5. POLICY STATEMENTS

### 5.1 General Substantiation Requirements

All employees **must** submit an Expense Report via the designated Expense Management System within **ten (10) business days** of the expense being incurred or the travel/project conclusion. Original or scanned/digital copies of itemized receipts **shall** accompany every expense submission, regardless of the amount, unless a Per Diem is utilized.

### 5.2 Receipt Thresholds

For all expenses under **Fifty Dollars (\$50.00 USD)**, a detailed business purpose must be stated on the Expense Report in lieu of a physical receipt. However, if a receipt is available, it **must** still be attached. For expenses **equal to or exceeding Fifty Dollars (\$50.00 USD)**, an itemized receipt **shall** be mandatory.

### 5.3 Approval Workflow

All Expense Reports **must** be approved sequentially. An employee’s direct Manager **must** review and approve all standard expenses. Expenses exceeding **Two Thousand Dollars (\$2,000.00 USD)** in total, or expenses related to executive travel (VP level and above), **shall** require additional review and approval by the Department Head and finally the CFO, to ensure SOX compliance regarding large financial outflows.

### 5.4 Meals and Entertainment

Reasonable business meals with clients or colleagues **will** be reimbursed, provided the attendees and the clear business purpose are documented on the Expense Report. The standard limit for individual employee meals while traveling, without management override, **is** **Seventy-Five Dollars (\$75.00 USD)** per day (when not using Per Diem). Alcohol expenses **must** be itemized separately and are discouraged unless directly related to necessary client entertainment.

### 5.5 Travel and Airfare

Employees **shall** book the most economical and reasonable travel options available. Airfare booked for domestic travel **must** be Economy or Coach class. Business Class airfare **is prohibited** unless the flight duration exceeds **six (6) hours** or is explicitly pre-approved by the Department Head. Employees **shall** provide justification when utilizing first-class seating or non-preferred airlines.

### 5.6 Mileage and Personal Vehicle Use

When using a personal vehicle for business travel, employees **will** be reimbursed at the current IRS standard mileage rate applicable on the date of travel. Mileage claims **must** be calculated using the Expense Management System’s integrated mapping tool to verify distance, and employees **must not** claim mileage for commuting between home and the primary place of business.

### 5.7 Technology and Software Subscriptions

Individual software subscriptions or technology purchases **must not** be expensed under this policy unless the expense is less than **One Hundred Dollars (\$100.00 USD)** and the tool is immediately necessary for a short-term project. All recurring or significant technology needs **shall** be procured through the IT Department procurement process.

### 5.8 Cash Advances

Cash advances are **prohibited** unless required for extended international travel where credit card availability is limited. Any cash advance greater than **Five Hundred Dollars (\$500.00 USD)** requires prior CFO approval. Outstanding cash advances **must** be reconciled against incurred expenses within **five (5) business days** of returning from travel. Failure to reconcile will result in the outstanding balance being deducted from the employee's next salary payment.

### 5.9 Foreign Currency Transactions

When submitting expenses in a foreign currency, the exchange rate used for reimbursement **shall** be the rate reflected on the credit card statement or an established conversion rate recognized by the Expense Management System at the time of the transaction. Employees **should not** utilize high-fee currency exchange services.
